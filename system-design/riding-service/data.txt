## Core Components

### 1. Architecture Overview
- Microservices architecture to manage different concerns
- API Gateway to manage client requests
- Event-driven design for real-time features

### 2. Key Services

#### User Service
- Authentication/Authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
- Profile management
- Payment methods
- Ratings/history

#### Driver Service
- Driver onboarding
- Availability management
- Earnings tracking
- Ratings system

#### Ride Service
- Ride requests
- Matching algorithms (drivers to riders)
- Route optimization
- Pricing calculations (surge pricing)

#### Payment Service
- Payment processing
- Subscription management
- Driver payouts
- Invoicing

#### Notification Service
- Push notifications
- SMS alerts
- Email communication
- In-app messaging

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Backend Technology
- **Languages**: Node.js (Express), Go, or Java Spring Boot
- **API**: RESTful APIs + GraphQL for complex queries
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live tracking/chat

### 2. Database Strategy
- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **Geo DB**: MongoDB/PostGIS for location services
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and frequent queries
- **Analytics**: Elasticsearch for data insights

### 3. Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

### 4. Maps & Location
- Integration with Google Maps API or Mapbox
- Real-time geolocation tracking
- Geocoding/reverse geocoding
- ETA calculations

### 5. Mobile Apps
- Native apps (iOS/Android) or cross-platform (React Native/Flutter)
- Offline functionality
- Background location tracking
- Deep linking

## Critical System Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Low-latency matching algorithm
- High throughput payment processing
- Efficient geospatial queries

### 2. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for peak usage times
- Database sharding for user growth
- Load balancing across regions

### 3. Reliability
- Fault tolerance with circuit breakers
- Redundancy in critical systems
- Data replication across availability zones

### 4. Security
- Encryption (in transit and at rest)
- PCI compliance for payments
- Fraud detection systems
- Regular security audits

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP
- Basic user/driver registration
- Simple ride requesting
- GPS tracking
- Payment integration

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Ride scheduling
- Enhanced matching algorithms
- Surge pricing
- Rating system

### Phase 3: Scaling
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced analytics
- Machine learning for predictions
- B2B features

## Additional Considerations

- **Legal**: Compliance with transportation regulations
- **Analytics**: Data pipeline for business intelligence
- **International**: Multi-currency, language support
- **Accessibility**: Features for riders with disabilities
- **Testing**: Load testing, chaos engineering practices
